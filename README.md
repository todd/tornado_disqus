## tornado_disqus
tornado_disqus provides a mixin for authenticating with and making calls to the [Disqus API](http://disqus.com/api/docs/). It is modeled after the default authentication mixins provided in tornado.auth, though there are some differences due to varying implementations of OAuth 2 by different services.

An example application is included to provide a super-simple sample implementation of the mixin.
